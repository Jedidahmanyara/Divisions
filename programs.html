        <h5><b>ICT for Development</b></h5>
        <p1>We offer basic and advanced digital skills to youth from the disadvantaged communities which are crucial in professional development.
             We believe that for young people to engage meaningfully in society, they must be equipped with 21st century skills and opportunities to advance their vision of a connected future. 
             Through this program, youth acquire not only skills but also model their IT-based or IT enabled  solutions.
