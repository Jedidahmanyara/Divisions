            <p>We support and build the capacities of youth and local communities to develop solutions that have social impact.
                 We place emphasis on skills enhancement, enterprise development and linking the youth to available opportunities locally and beyond.
                 Consequently, we empower communities to tap into the limited resources they have, identify their social problems, and craft and pursue solutions that work for them.</p>
